    "Morphogenesis during embryo development requires the coordination of mechanical forces to generate the macroscopic shapes of organs. To understand these processes, a full 3D description of the cells is needed. In this session, we will study a theoretical model, based on cell adhesion and actomyosin contractility, which describes the various shapes of epithelial cells and the bending and buckling of epithelial sheets, as well as the relative stability of cellular tubes and spheres. The morphologies observed in vivo can be understood as stable points of mechanical equations and the transitions between them are either continuous or discontinuous. From this model, will study the equilibrium configuration of the cells, and derive simple scaling laws, that can be verified experimentally.\n",
    "The authors also studied the buckling instability of epithelia, driven by a flattening of individual cell shapes.\n",

    "# I - Morphologies of planar epithelial cells\n",
    "We model epithelial cells as hexagonal prisms of base length r and height h. We consider only cohesive sheets and, at first, we do not implement any constraint on the total area of the sheet. Considering all cells as identical, we write the force balance equation on a single cell, which we consider planar in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although the tissue is an out-of-equilibrium system, it is convenient to write the mechanical equilibrium at steady state as the minimization of a work function, or effective energy $\\mathcal{F}$, where the nonequilibrium aspect is hidden in the tensions.  We define a cell as columnar when $\\dfrac{h}{r}>>1$, cuboidal when $\\dfrac{h}{r} \\approx 1$ and squamous when $\\dfrac{h}{r}<<1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epithelial cells display an apico-basal polarity: the adhesion with the substrate defines the basal surface, whereas a contractile actomyosin belt often forms on the upper, apical surface. \n",
    "We thus consider the following contributions to the effective energy: \n",
    "- a cell–substrate energy, proportional to the basal area, $\\gamma_b \\mathcal{A}_{basal}$.\n",
    "- a cell–cell lateral energy, proportional to the lateral area, $\\alpha_l \\mathcal{A}_{lat}$.\n",
    "- an energy associated to the tension of the apical actomyosin belt $\\Lambda_a$, proportional to the apical perimeter, $\\Lambda_a \\mathcal{P}_{ap}$.\n",
    "- the confinement energy of the cytoplasmic components (nucleus, intermediate filanements..) : $A\\left( \\frac{1}{h^2} + 2 \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right)$ (confinement of Gaussian polymers to a thickness h or a thickness r, depending on the regime).\n",
    "\n",
    "The lateral tension $\\alpha_l$ is the sum of several contributions of opposite signs : a positive contribution from contractile forces of the actomyosin lateral cortex, which tends to minimize the lateral surface, and a negative contribution from the adhesion with the neighboring cells, which tends to maximize the lateral surface. The tensions could also have contributions from external stresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the energy takes the following form : \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F} = \\gamma_b \\mathcal{A}_{basal} - \\alpha_l \\mathcal{A}_{lat} + \\Lambda_a \\mathcal{P}_{ap} + A\\left( \\frac{1}{h^2} + 2 \\frac{1}{r^2} \\right)$\n",

    "# Epithelial Sheet Bending - The buckling instability\n",
    "\n",
    "we consider the confinement of an epithelium to an area different from its equilibrium value. If this occurs, cells can accommodate the decreased area by increasing their height. However, the area accessible to cells can also increase to its value dictated by mechanical equilibrium through an out-of-plane deformation of the entire sheet. This occurs if the energetic cost of bending the sheet is larger than the energetic cost of compression and is analogous to the Eulerian buckling of an elastic sheet under compression. For example, during Drosophila wing development, the columnar epithelium forms several folds. Moreover, local mutations affecting the actin belt cause the epithelium to collapse to a lower height and a bigger area and thus to form additional folds.\n",

Not surprisingly, large wavelengths (i.e $q \\to 0$) are favored and reduce the buckling energy, because less bending is required of each individual cell. The preferred wavelength is then the length of the sheet L, with a critical confinement threshold\n",

    "# Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking into account the 3-dimensionnal geometry of the cells allows for a wide range of new behaviour in epithelial sheets, where out-of-plane effects appears. In recent years, experimentalists have demonstrated curling and buckling behaviours using in-vitro experiments, that can also be observed in the embryonic development, and seems to be key to create complex shapes from a single cell. The control and regulation of such mechanisms is an active topic of research, linking biology and mechanical modeling.\n",
