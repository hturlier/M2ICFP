    "__Periodic patterns__ are found in a wide variety of different organisms, forming across a large range of time and length scales. A number of different models have been proposed to explain the formation of these periodic patterns, most notably Turing’s __reaction-diffusion__ model in which periodicity is generated at the molecular scale. The canonical reaction-diffusion model involves two diffusing molecules: a __rapidly diffusing inhibitor__ molecule and a __slowly diffusing activator__ molecule. Provided that the activator stimulates production of both itself and its inhibitor sufficiently strongly, and that the inhibitor diffuses sufficiently more rapidly than the activator, periodic patterns can spontaneously emerge from an initially homogeneous pattern (termed a __Turing instability__).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](Images/Zebrafish.png \"Title\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The property that forms the focus of this work is __pattern orientation__. Stripes in animal pigment patterns often have a __stereotyped__ direction; e.g., wild-type zebrafish have __stripes parallel__ to their long axis during normal development. However, during aberrant patterning, for example, when the pattern regenerates after damage, or when the pattern proceeds in the absence of some organizing signal, the tight regulation of pattern orientaion is impaired, and we can observe __labyrinthine stripes__ on his body. This phenotype disruption shows that the orientation of the pattern requires to be __regulated__.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is based on a single variable description of a generic Turing instability: the __Swift-Hohenberg__ equation. With this equation, the authors find three different ways to orient reliably the stripes of the pattern. During this session, we will study two of them : the morphogen gradient and the tissue anisotropy. \n",
